Tools Description is as follows,

search_tool:

This tool uses a Language Model (LLM) to retrieve source links relevant to the user's query. It generates source links by applying a predefined prompt based on the user's input, helping the agent identify the most pertinent web pages.

crawl_urls_tool:

This tool utilizes Crawl4AI for scraping or crawling content from the source links identified by the search_tool. After scraping the content from the source, it uses PruningContentFilter to extract only the necessary and relevant data from the web pages. The tool generates a markdown document based on the filtered content.

summarize_markdown_tool:

This tool uses a Language Model (LLM) to summarize the markdown document generated by the crawl_urls_tool. The tool applies a predefined prompt to generate a concise and informative summary from the markdown, providing the user with the most important information.

Flow of the Agent:
The user inputs a query.
The search_tool identifies relevant source links.
The crawl_urls_tool scrapes and filters the content from these source links.
The summarize_markdown_tool then processes the scraped content, summarizing it for the user.
